# URGENT: Fix MCP Authentication Issue

## Problem Identified ‚úÖ
Your MCP connection works! The error is **authentication mismatch**:
- ‚úÖ MCP Server Trigger is listening
- ‚úÖ SSE endpoint is accessible  
- ‚ùå Authentication credentials don't match

## Immediate Solution

### Option A: Remove Authentication (Recommended for testing)

1. **Open n8n**: http://localhost:5678
2. **Edit your workflow**
3. **MCP Server Trigger node**:
   - Set Authentication: **"None"**
   - Save
4. **MCP Client node**:
   - Set Authentication: **"None"**  
   - Save
5. **Test the connection**

### Option B: Fix Credentials (If you prefer auth)

1. **Create matching credentials**:
   - Go to Credentials in n8n
   - Create new "HTTP Header Auth" credential
   - Set header name: `Authorization`
   - Set header value: `Bearer your-token-here`
   - Save with a memorable name

2. **Use same credential** in both:
   - MCP Server Trigger
   - MCP Client

## Test Commands

After removing authentication:
```bash
# This should work without "Authorization data is wrong!"
curl -N "http://localhost:5678/mcp/754ab685-0173-4eec-a996-1d56f9dc8339/sse"
```

## Why This Happened
- Your original workflow had auth configured
- When we restored the data, the credential references broke
- MCP Server expects auth, MCP Client sends different/no auth

## Next Steps
1. Remove auth from both nodes (fastest solution)
2. Test MCP connection 
3. Your AI Agent should work immediately
4. Re-add auth later if needed

The core MCP functionality is working - it's just an auth configuration issue! üéâ
