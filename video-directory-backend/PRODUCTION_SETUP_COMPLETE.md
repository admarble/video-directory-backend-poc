## 📋 **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS** (60-90 minutes)

### **1. External Service Setup (40 minutes):**
```bash
# Create accounts and get credentials:
# 🔧 Sentry.io → Get DSN
# 🖼️ Cloudinary.com → Get API credentials  
# 📊 Google Analytics → Get Measurement ID
# ⚡ Redis Cloud → Get connection URL (or use local Redis)
```

### **2. GitHub Repository Setup (20 minutes):**
```bash
# Push code to GitHub
git add .
git commit -m "Production infrastructure complete"
git push origin main

# Add GitHub Secrets:
# - PAYLOAD_SECRET
