## 🚀 Next Steps for Production Launch:

### 1. External Service Setup (30 minutes):
- [ ] Create Sentry account → Add DSN to `.env.production`
- [ ] Create Cloudinary account → Add credentials to `.env.production`
- [ ] Setup Google Analytics 4 → Add measurement ID
- [ ] Setup Redis Cloud or local Redis instance

### 2. GitHub Repository Setup (15 minutes):
- [ ] Push code to GitHub repository
- [ ] Add GitHub Secrets:
  - `PAYLOAD_SECRET`
  - `DATABASE_URI`
  - `SENTRY_DSN`
  - `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`
- [ ] Add GitHub Variables:
  - `PRODUCTION_URL`
  - `STAGING_URL`

### 3. Hosting Platform Setup (20 minutes):
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel (recommended) or Railway
- [ ] Setup MongoDB Atlas production database
- [ ] Configure environment variables on hosting platform
- [ ] Setup custom domain with SSL

### 4. Production Verification (15 minutes):
- [ ] Test all API endpoints
- [ ] Verify error monitoring
- [ ] Test caching performance
- [ ] Validate analytics tracking
- [ ] Confirm backup system
